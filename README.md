**Disclaimer**: the current list is not all-inclusive...but you all can help by adding your favorite Austin drinking spots

## Installation

React js and Semantic UI are responsible for the design of this app

## Usage

Users can view popular bars and breweries as cute card designs containing all the pertinent information:  
1. Cards have a corner paw-print tag if they are pet-friendly
2. An "outdoor seating" label is present if locations have patios
3. Hours of operation are neatly listed out 
4. The "website" button contains a link to the location's official website
